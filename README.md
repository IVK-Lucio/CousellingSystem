# CousellingSystem
In the world we live in, the internet has become more and more important. Many people use it in their day-to-day lives. They collect information from the internet; they also go to the internet to look for information. This also happens with job vacancies. People go to company websites looking for new vacancies, but once they receive the information about the vacancies they do not know how to proceed from there. This research will focus on co-designing a counseling system with the young adults that will be used to supply employment opportunities in Namibia that will allow any young adult, educated or not to take advantage of these opportunities as well as get motivated to make their own opportunities when there are none.
